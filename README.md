# Lightweight [Foundation for Emails](http://foundation.zurb.com/emails)

Foundation for Emails (previously known as Ink) is a framework for creating responsive HTML emails that work in any email client.

Unfortunately, the GMAIL email client, has a limit for the sended html file. The Foundation, add uneeded rules to all the components,
with style inline maded by gulp tasks in the template.

## More Info

This [repo](https://github.com/joaopjt/foundation-emails-lightweight) is a fork from [foundation-emails by zurb](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-emails/).
We've removed, mostly, rules of style.

if you need this structure, i highly recommend, to use my own template fork too!
Some rules are in the template, so, you may have some troubles with this repo only.
